# üîè What is SecureBoot?
SecureBoot is a Security System which prevents non-certified programs from starting with the System. <br>
Unfortunately this Easy Installation Script Requires having SecureBoot Disabled.

# üì¥ Here You Have 2 Deactivation Methods;

<details>
<summary>üë®‚Äçüíª Disable SecureBoot from BIOS</summary>
This method Disables SecureBoot and Allows the Execution of all types of Systems and Applications when Starting the PC.<br>
To Deactivate SecureBoot with this method, you must restart the PC, and when it turns on, you must press the `Setup` key that appears on the screen. This is usually `F2` `F12` or `DEL` <br>
Then use the keyboard arrows to search for the System, Start, Security or BOOT Section and SecureBoot should appear in a Sub Menu, set it to off, save and restart. <br>
This varies by PC, here I will leave some examples of some brands;

<summary>üîè No need to enter the BIOS</summary>
This is a Semi-Automatic Installation Script that Installs YoursBootloader. Requires a one-time Interaction to Add a Key. <br>
SecureBoot is not deactivated here, Replace the Previous Key with a Global Use Key so that Programs with this key Can Run. <br>
This Replaces the BOOT folder of the EFI partition, this may not work on Computers with Firmware 2024 and Higher.<br>
