## üîì How to Disable SecureBoot?
<details>
<summary>Steps to Follow; ‚¨áÔ∏è</summary>
<h2> üîè What is SecureBoot? </h2>
SecureBoot is a Security System which prevents non-certified programs from starting with the System. <br>
Unfortunately this Script Requires having SecureBoot Disabled since it is not signed by Microsoft

### üë®‚Äçüíª Disable SecureBoot from BIOS;
To Deactivate SecureBoot with this method, you must restart the PC, and when it turns on, you must press the `Setup` key that appears on the screen. This is usually `F2` `F12` or `DEL` <br>
Then Search through the keyboard arrows for the Section `System\System`, `Start\Boot`, `Security` and in a Sub Menu SecureBoot should appear, set it to off, save and restart. <br>
This varies by PC, Here are some Examples; <br>

## ü§® What does this do to my PC?
The Executable decompresses all this in C:/MiLinux/ <br>
If UEFI is detected, install [rEFIndx64](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) <br>
In case of BIOS Detect, Install [Grub2Win](https://sourceforge.net/projects/grub2win/) <br>
Added modules like [vdiskchain and ipxe](https://github.com/ventoy/vdiskchain) that are necessary for VDI Boot <br>
A 25GB VDI is added in C:/MiLinux/MiLinux.vtoy. This is the Linux Disk. <br>
Set rEFInd or Grub2 as Boot Manager. <br>
