## üîè What is SecureBoot?
SecureBoot is a Security System which prevents non-certified programs from starting with the System. <br>
Unfortunately this Script Requires having SecureBoot Disabled since it is not signed by Microsoft

### üë®‚Äçüíª Disable SecureBoot from BIOS;
To Deactivate SecureBoot with this method, you must restart the PC, and when it turns on, you must press the `Setup` key that appears on the screen. This is usually `F2` `F12` or `DEL` <br>
Then search through the keyboard arrows for the Section `System\System`, `Start\Boot`, `Security` and in a Sub Menu SecureBoot should appear, set it to off, save and restart. <br>
This varies by PC, here I will leave some examples of some brands; <br>
