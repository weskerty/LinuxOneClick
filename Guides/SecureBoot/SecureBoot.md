# üîè What is SecureBoot?
SecureBoot is a Security System which prevents non-certified programs from starting with the System. <br>
Unfortunately this Easy Installation Script Requires having SecureBoot Disabled.

#3Ô∏è‚É£ Here are 3 Alternatives You Can Try
<details>
<summary>üîè No need to enter the BIOS</summary>
This is a Semi-Automatic Installation Script that Requires Interaction. This does not disable SecureBoot, but adds a globally used key so that programs with this key can run. <br>
Yours Bootloader will be installed, a variant of rEFInd that Replaces the BOOT folder of the EFI partition, this may not work on Computers with Firmware of 2024 and Higher.<br>
Here is a demonstration video of what you should do;

This will replace the previous SecureBoot Key to allow this Key/Certificate to be executed.

<summary>üë®‚Äçüíª Disable SecureBoot from BIOS</summary>
The best option, it allows the execution of all types of systems and applications when starting the PC.<br>
To Deactivate SecureBoot with this method, you must restart the PC, and when it turns on, you must press the `Setup` key that appears on the screen. This is usually `F2` `F12` or `DEL` <br>
Then use the keyboard arrows to search for the System, Start, Security or BOOT Section and SecureBoot should appear in a Sub Menu, set it to off, save and restart. <br>
This varies by PC, here I will leave some examples of some brands;
